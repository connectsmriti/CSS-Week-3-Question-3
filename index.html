          <strong>Jhol Momo</strong> <br>
          Jhol basically means liquid or having a liquid-like consistency, and Jhol momos are the momos that are drowned in a bowl full of sauce called jhol achar. The sauce or jhol achar is thin in texture and have a bit of a hot, spicy and tangy twist. We believe, Le Trio and GG Machhan are two of the best places to have Jhol Momo in Kathmandu valley.
